Grey Scale Image Stitcher Using SIFT and Homography

Two greyscale images are stitched using sift and homography matrix concept. Implementation is done on Octave(Open Source), 
 but code can be run onMatlab as well with small syntax changes.

The Repository contains:

a) bunch of images to test the code
b) fucnction files to implement homography
c) "Run Script Octave" file which has exact method call to test the implementation
d) you will need download "SIFT demo progrem" from https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/ for matching sift --> just download the zip file 
from the site , unzip it , place all the contents of this repository in the unzipped folder --> open this folder in Octave/Matlab --> run
commands from "Run Script Octave" file to test 

e) Improved version of the code will be posted soon!!!
